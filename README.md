#Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects I created while taking various courses, primarily from gamedev.tv on Udemy.

I have decided to showcase just one project from each course I've completed, as these courses have provided me with a wealth of projects. These projects serve as demonstrations of my skills and knowledge gained during my learning journey.

#Project Highlights

Physics-Based Driving Game: One of the projects I've included in this repository is a driving game, "Delivery Driver". I've made significant additions and modifications to this project, resulting in a completely different physics-based driving system compared to the original course content.

#Courses Completed

Over a span of two years, I have completed numerous courses that cover a wide range of topics. While there are many projects in this repository, I have chosen to highlight my personal favorites to provide a glimpse into my progress and proficiency as a developer. These three courses are;

Complete C# Unity Game Developer 2D
